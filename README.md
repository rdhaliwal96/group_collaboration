# group_collaboration-


When I began working on my portion of the project, I started to focus on the hypothesis and the questions my group and I generated. After we decided to hone in on 'Life expectancy' I figured to think, what defines a 'young' and/or 'aging' country. After collborating with my group, I found that countires with a high birthrate and a high death rate made for 'young' countries.

Countires with a low birthrate and a low death rate made for an 'old' country.
