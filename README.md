#Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.

Does GDP have an impact on Life Expectancy?
- I took a look at countries of the world and life expectancy data provided by Kaggle and World Bank Data Catalog.  With this data, there was a merge of data based on countries. 
- From this, I took the average life expectancy ages and sorted them into bins.  From there, calculated the average GPD of the countries they were in.  
- A country's GDP has one of the biggest impacts on life expectancy. There is a clear coorelation that the higher a country's GPD, the higher the life expectancy. 


Does GPD and Population have an impact on Life Expectancy?
- Using the combined Kaggle and World Bank Data Catalog, I created a bubble chart to see if there may be a coorelation on population size and the ability to have high GDP.
- There continues to be a higher coorelation between GPD and life expectancy and population does not have an impact on life expectancy. 

Does Free Health Care help increase Life Expectancy?
- Using data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, I merge the data together to get a list of countries that provide Free Health Care and their Life Expectancy. 
- Average Life Expectancy increase by 10 years for countries that provide Free Health Care. 


Does Universal Health Care help increase Life Expectancy? 
- Similar method to Free Health Care, I combined data from Wikipedia and Kaggle to get a list of countries that provide Universal Health Care. Just like Free Health Care, the average Life Expectancy increases by 10 years for countries that provide Universal Health Care
