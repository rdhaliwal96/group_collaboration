# group_collaboration-
This project based on data sets that were taken from Kaggle and The World Bank Data Catalog. They consist information on world population, average life expectancy, infant mortality, fertility rate, gdp, climate and more. This project analyzes the average life expectancy rate for each country and how it changes over time. Also this project answers the question if there is any correlation between life expectancy, infant mortality, fertility rate and climate. 

The final report includes the following plots:

* Countries by Life Expectancy 2016
* Average Life Excpectancy in the World Over Time
* Average Fertility Rate in the World Over Time
* Life Expectancy vs GDP and Climate
* Infant mortality vs GDP and Climate
* Fertility Rate vs GDP and Climate

Project Findings:

* There is some correlation between climate and life expectancy. Almost all the countries with high rates of life expectancy are located in the coolest part of the graph. There is also a strong correlation between GDP and life expectancy. Citizens of the countries with the highest GDP live longer.

* There is no correlation between climate and infant mortality and fertility rate. They are correlated by GDP size.

This project was completed using the pandas, numpy, scipy.stats and Matplotlib libraries, and Jupiter Notebook.
